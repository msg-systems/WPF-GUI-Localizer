**!!This library is still under developement!!**

# WPF-GUI-Localizer

## Introduction

This library offers the functionality to add or optimize localization in WPF applications at runtime. By applying a right-click event to every localizable element (Label, Button etc.), it opens a dialog in which the translations for any language can be edited.

It comes along with the ability to localize WPF applications using either human-readable Excel files or traditional Resources (.resx) files.

## Install

The WPF-GUI-Localizer library is available through NuGet (once it is finished, that is).

You can run an example application with this library already integrated here (again, not yet).

Read more about how to get set up with your own application [here](Docs/documentation.md#setup).
